# ToTheStarts_SpaceJam
## Description:
In To The Stars, your goal is to save this species of bug from extinction on planet XE-13-2-2.  To move the bug click anywhere on the screen and they will move towards that location.  The main goal is to save as many bugs by bringing them to the spaceship which is located somewhere in the level.  Enemies will try to eat the bugs, but the bugs can defend themselves.  After defending themselves, bugs may evolve to become stronger and more resilient against future predators.
